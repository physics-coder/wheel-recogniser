# Wheel recogniser
Welcome to the app, that allows you to play computer games with a wheel from anywhere you want! All you need is a camera, a cardboard wheel and some driving skills. 

# How to use
Once you download the program files and install the required libraries, open main.py. You will be greeted with an interface, where you will need to select
the time for you to switch to your game after you start, the wheel sensitivity, and push the big start button if everything goes well! If you want to pause 
the game, just press the button stop, to resume press Start again. Happy gaming!
